# ffmpeg batch convert TUI
Make an [EDN](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.edn) file with keys being the files to be converted to MP4 and their values being the
filename you want the converted file to have.

The TUI will show a task list in the terminal which shows percent progress and an ETA for the currently converting file.  Completed
files show the time that the conversion finished.
